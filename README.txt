This is a game created to introduce high school students to simple programming, for the NY State 4H Program hosted at Cornell University in Summer 2016, made with guidance from Professor Nate Foster. As part of the program is learning about water quality and management, this game includes the element of water quality.

Ways to play the game:
1. The main game has the student acting as a mayor of a new town. As he zones areas of land for  different uses, he can make a profit but river pollution will increase. The goal is to maximize profit while minimizing pollution.

2. To teach students the basics of pollution modeling, the amount of pollution each land use generates can be changed via sliders. In this game mode, a town is already in place on the map. The student can then change the pollution of each type using the slider, with the goal of matching a given total pollution number. This mimics the role of researchers calibrating GIS pollution models. 


The program is written in Processing, a language that is backed by Java, but with much easier graphics.
